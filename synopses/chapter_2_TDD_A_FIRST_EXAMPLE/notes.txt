 
 Uncle Bob's Three Rules of TDD
 ==============================

 - write production code only to make a failing test pass
 - write no more of a unit test that sufficient to fail,
   compilation failures are failures
 - write only the production code needed to pass the one failing test

 These rules can be transformed
 - write a new test
   // the test will be not compiled,
 - write the production code only for test compilation
   but failing when running
   // the test will be compiled
   // the test will fail
 - write the production code to pass the test
   // the test will pass
 - redesign your code and your tests (if necessary)
 

 Each test is independent.
 Each test must set up its own context.
 
 
 Fixtures
 ========

 Google Mock let us define a fixture class in which we can declare
 functions and member data for a related set of tests.

 Google Mock instantiates the fixture class one per test.

 The rule of thumb for TDD is one assert per test.
