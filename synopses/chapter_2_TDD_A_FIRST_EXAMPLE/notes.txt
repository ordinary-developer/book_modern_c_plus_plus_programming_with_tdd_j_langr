 Uncle Bob's Three Rules of TDD
 ==============================

 - write production code only to make a failing test pass
 - write no more of a unit test that sufficient to fail,
   compilation failures are failures
 - write only the production code needed to pass the one failing test

 These rules can be transformed
 - write a new test
   // the test will be not compiled,
 - write the production code only for test compilation
   // the test will be compiled
   // the test will fail
 - write the production code to pass the test
   // the test will pass
 - redesign your code
